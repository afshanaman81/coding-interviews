Given: 

Route object contains index/identifier, the distance (Dr), and the direction (forward or reverse)

Aircraft object contains a forward route, a return route and its maximum optimal distance (Da)


Conditions:
Da <= 2Dr

Problem: Find the set of optimal routes for an aircraft


Input:
1. Array of forward Routes, Array of Return Routes
2. Aircraft

const forwardRoutes = [2, 4, 7, 10]
const returnRoutes  = []
const aircraft = {maxDistance: 7}


Output:
optimal pair (Index of Forward Route, index of Return Route)
